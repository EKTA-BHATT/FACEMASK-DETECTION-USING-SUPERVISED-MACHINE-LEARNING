The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the new coronavirus outbreak, a “Pandemic”
Common signs of infection include fever, coughing and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, it can cause pneumonia and death [1].
While researchers continue to learn more about the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, it is extremely important to maintain safety measures until a vaccine is ready. Wearing a facemask is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of the virus.
